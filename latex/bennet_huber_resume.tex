   {\bf Datapath Org} - Datapath is a serverless execution platform and programming language designed for high throughput, low latency execution of business logic organized in an SOA architecture.  It powers a significant portion of the real-time backend business logic for amazon.com traffic, and is used by hundreds of internal teams and thousands of developers.  I've worked on most of the pieces over the years, but much of my recent work has focused on evolving the deployment system to scale from dozens of customer deployments/day five years ago to thousands currently.  My current project is adding the concept of a "onebox" to the deployment system and runtime to enable multi-step production deployments for our customers, helping reduce the blast radius of bad changes.

   {\bf Featured Merchant Algorithm (FMA) Team} - owns the logic that picks which merchant offer is tied to Amazon's "Add to Cart" button. It is a low latency, high throughput system - its logic is invoked millions of times per second worldwide with latency on the order of 10s of milliseconds.  While on FMA, I developed a shadow traffic automated testing mechanism to reduce developer time to run integration tests from several hours to a few minutes.  I designed and implemented a new version of their public API, still in use five years later.
