   Datapath is a serverless execution platform and language designed for high throughput, low latency execution of business logic defined in an SOA architecture across hundreds of development teams.  It powers a significant portion of the real-time backend business logic for amazon.com traffic.  I've worked on most of the pieces over the years, but much of my recent work has focused on evolving the deployment system to scale from dozens of customer deployments/day five years ago to thousands currently.  My current project is adding the concept of a "onebox" to the deployment system and runtime to enable multi-step production deployments for our customers, helping reduce the blast radius of bad changes.

   Featured Merchant Algorithm (FMA) Team - owns the logic that picks which merchant offer is tied to Amazon's "Add to Cart" button. It is a low latency, high throughput system - its logic is invoked millions of times per second worldwide with latency on the order of 10s of milliseconds.  While on FMA I developed a shadow traffic automated testing mechanism to reduce developer time to run integration tests from several hours to a few minutes.  I also wrote and implemented a new version of their public API, still in use nearly five years later.

   Azavea is a medium sized consulting firm specializing in web/mobile
   applications related to GIS problems.  I worked
   on teams of two to six people and projects lasting from
   several months to many years.  I was a full-stack developer working on
   things such as UI design and implementation, application logic, spatial
   predictive modelling, distributed architecture design, application
   deployment, and database schema design.  One of the primary projects I
   worked on is called HunchLab, a product designed for crime analysts that
   implements many cutting-edge crime prediction algorithms and statistical
   models.
